# MLatom with GICnet model

## GICnet model

The GICnet model is a realization of the concept of 4D-spacetime atomistic artificial intelligence models for molecules. The concept and models are described in 

* Fuchun Ge, Lina Zhang, Arif Ullah, Pavlo O. Dral*. Four-dimensional spacetime atomistic artificial intelligence models. J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2023, in press. DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpclett.3c01592.
See also [preprint on ChemRxiv](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2022-qf75v).

The model is implemented by Fuchun Ge of [Pavlo O. Dral's group](http://dr-dral.com) in the development version of [MLatom](https://github.com/dralgroup/mlatom). This implementation was used for obtaining the results reported in the above manuscript. The latest code snapshot of this implementation is available in [figshare](https://figshare.com/s/132c64e172ffd835d470).

**Important note:** This branch will not be further updated, please check and use the future official releases of MLatom with the latest implementations, manuals, and tutorials of the GICnet model. Future implementations may contain many changes.

## Pre-trained models
Pre-trained GICnet models for all molecules are available in [figshare](https://figshare.com/s/132c64e172ffd835d470).

## About MLatom
MLatom is a package for atomistic simulations with machine learning. See the official website [MLatom.com](http://mlatom.com) for more information.
